# roi-extraction-rtl-fpga-stereo_MACE
Designed and implemented two hardware-efficient Verilog architectures for real-time Region of Interest (ROI) extraction from multi-channel ADC data streams for the Stereo MACE Telescope. Integrated multiple synchronized FSMs with inter-FSM handshaking to manage latency-constrained BRAM read/write operations. Deployed and validated the RTL design on Xilinx FPGA with real-time hardware debugging using Vivado ILA, followed by a comparative performance analysis of both architectures.
